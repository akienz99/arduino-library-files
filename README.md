# Standard Arduino libraries
This Repository contains a copy of the standard Arduino libraries. This is useful
for creating Ctag-files because you normally cannot access the built-in libraries
like Wire.h for that matter.

## Licence note
These libraries are licenced under the GNU LGPL Version 2. A copy of that can be
found in the LICENSE file.
